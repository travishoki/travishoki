			<p><strong>App Description:</strong></p>
			<p>The Putting Tour has created a putting tournament where players put at a kiosk and their scores and videos are recorded and put to a tournament on line. The putting green has sensors in the holes that sends keycodes to the app if the ball made it into the whole or not. The app recored the scores and posts them to the website where they are put into a tournament.</p>

			<br/>

			<p><strong>My Contribution:</strong></p>
			<p>I helped to create the app in Flash with object oriented AS3. I programmed the app to recode scores according to the key codes that the censors in the wholes returned to the app. Then sent the scores to the API.</p>

			<br/>

			<p><strong>Languages:</strong></p>
			<p>The App is done in Flash using ActionScript 3, then the scores are sent to and API which places the user into a tournament with PHP.</p>
